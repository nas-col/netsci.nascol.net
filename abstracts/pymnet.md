## pymnet: A Python Library for Multilayer Networks

**Abstract:** Multilayer networks extend classical network representations to capture the rich, intertwined relationships found in modern data, whether they describe transportation systems, social interactions, biological pathways, or brain connectivity. *pymnet* is an open-source Python library designed to make multilayer-network analysis as accessible and efficient as single-layer graph analysis, while providing powerful visualisation, graphlet and isomorphism analysis and random multilayer generative models. In this talk I will motivate the need for multilayer representations and introduce pymnet's approach and interface. The talk will also focus on the challenges and hard-won lessons of modernising and maintaining long-running scientific software, especially software with dependencies on native extensions, in a fast-moving Python ecosystem.
