**Abstract:** In this presentation I will share a public repository of data on degree extracted from over 50 unique datasets on child and adolescent friendship networks (https://osf.io/5y2dt/). After describing what these data contain, I will illustrate their use in two ways. First, these data have been used in published meta-analyses designed to understand methodological and demographic predictors of children's and adolescents' number of friends (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2024.10.001, https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2024.2). Second, these data are being used as training data for a Large Language Model (LLM) designed to extract this information from the broader network literature at scale for a more comprehensive repository and meta-analysis.
