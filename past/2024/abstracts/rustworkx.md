**Abstract:** Rustworkx is a general-purpose graph library focused on performance. It is written in the Rust programming language and provides both a Rust API and a flexible Python interface as well. Rustworkx focuses on building dynamic networks where you're interacting with graph data structures, modifying them, and analyzing them. This talk will provide an introduction to Rustworkx, the library's capabilities, and show some examples of current usage of the library.
