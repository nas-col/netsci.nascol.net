## NetworKit

**Speaker:** Fabian Brandt-Tumescheit

**Website:** [https://networkit.github.io/](https://networkit.github.io/)

**Abstract:** NetworKit is a continuously growing open-source toolkit for large-scale network analysis. The goal is to provide tools for the analysis of large networks in the size range from thousands to billions of edges. For networks of this size, exact algorithms often do not finish in reasonable time. To solve this, NetworKit implements efficient and often parallel approximation algorithms. For dynamic graphs, NetworKit goes one step further and combines approximation with batch updates, enabling significantly reduced running time for time-varying real-world use-cases. In the talk we will cover how dynamic algorithms are designed in NetworKit and show the capabilities of the rich Python interface including visualization. As an example, we will deal with a fully-dynamic approximation algorithm for the popular Betweenness centrality.
