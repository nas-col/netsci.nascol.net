## Welcome

The **Software and Data for Supporting Network Science** event is a satellite meeting of [NetSci 2025](https://netsci2025.github.io/). The goal of the event is to facilitate communication and cooperation between the users and developers of network analysis sofware packages, as well as to provide a venue for presenting software-focused work at NetSci. **We encourage NetSci participants [to submit abstracts](cfa) of software and data-related talks.**

Network analysis software packages and standardized datasets are essential tools for network science research, and are also used extensively in many other disciplines. Even though most network scientists regularly rely on such tools, research software is not yet considered first-class output of academic work, on par with research publications. This presents challenges for the long-term sustainability of such tools. This software and data-focused NetSci satellite is a small step towards remedying this situation.

This event is organized by members of the [Network Analysis Software Collective](https://nascol.net) (NASCol).

## The Network Analysis Software Collective

The [Network Analysis Software Collective](https://nascol.net) (NASCol) is a collaboration of prominent network analysis software projects to promote cooperation and help make network science software sustainable in the long term. The satellite meeting will serve as an opportunity to expand NASCol and strengthen collaboration within the nertwork science software ecosystem.
